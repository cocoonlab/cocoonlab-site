# Cocoon Lab Marketing Site — Design Notes

This project zip was generated by ChatGPT (GPT-5.1 Pro) as part of a design exercise.

The full design system, hero redesign, and section-by-section UX specification
are described in the ChatGPT conversation. Developers should:

- Implement the color, typography, spacing, and component tokens from the spec.
- Update the hero layout and navigation per the hero section spec.
- Rework the Product, How it works, Use cases, Customers, Pricing, and Resources
  sections following the structure and narrative described there.
- Place each of the existing figures (`public/images/*.png`) according to the
  figure placement map in the spec.

This file is only a pointer; it intentionally keeps the code unchanged so that
design and implementation can be iterated together in your own workflow.
